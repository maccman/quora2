Redesigning [Quora](http://quora.com)'s interface, turning it into a JavaScript web application powered by [Spine](http://maccman.github.com/spine).

Built using [Spine](http://maccman.github.com/spine) and [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script).

[Live demo](http://maccman.github.com/quora2/) (Chrome/Safari only due to CSS specifics)
